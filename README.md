# CRYPTO Landing Page

An interactive and dynamic landing page using HTML, Sass, and vanilla JavaScript. It is connected to the coin gecko api and the alpha advantage api. 

## How the APIs work

The coingecko API pulls data from the top five crypto currencies. These are displayed in the second section of the landing page. The alpha advantage api is used on the third section of the landing page. It allows you to convert cryptocurrencies into a currency. This is the free version of the API, so the amount of times it can be used per minute is limited. 

## What I learned

This provided a much needed refresher on how to use the DOM to manipulate data on a website. It was also good to have some more practice with working with APIs. I was also able to practice using Sass and implementing MixIns. Altogether it was a fun and easy project.
